Given the transactions table and table containing exchange rates. Exchange rate timestamps are rounded to second, transaction timestamps are rounded up to the millisecond. We have only data for one day, 1st of April, 2018. Please note there are no exchange rates from GBP to GBP as it is always 1

Write down a query that gives us a breakdown of spend in GBP by each user. Use the exchange rate with the largest timestamp. 
Write down the same query, but this time, use the latest exchange rate smaller or equal then the transaction timestamp. The solution should have the two columns: user_id, total_spent_gbp, ordered by user_id
Bonus for Postgres superstars: Consider the same schema, but now let’s add some random data, to simulate real scale: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/c6a70 or https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_9.6&fiddle=231257838892f0198c58bb5f46fb0d5d Write a solution for the previous task. Please ensure It executes within 5 seconds.
